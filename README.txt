Because the test doesn't require that the 3 generated random numbers must be 3 different numbers, so same numbers between 1-10 are allowed.
For example: [4, 4, 10] is a valid numbers array.

There is file [numbergame-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar] in /build/libs.
You can execute the file and access localhost:8080 to test the game.
